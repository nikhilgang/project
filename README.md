This wonderful repository contains the projects of Machine Learning which helps beginner to gets hands on Machine Learning .

# Breast- Cancer Prediction
# Heart Disease Prediction

Dataset :
The dataset consists of 779 individuals data. There are 15 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 14 columns.

Age : displays the age of the individual.
Sex : displays the gender of the individual using the following format : 1 = male 0 = female.
Chest-pain type : displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format : 1 = typical angina 2 = atypical angina 3 = non - anginal pain 4 = asymptotic
Resting Blood Pressure : displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
Serum Cholestrol : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)
Fasting Blood Sugar : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 (true) else : 0 (false)
Resting ECG : 0 = normal 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
Max heart rate achieved : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
Exercise induced angina : 1 = yes 0 = no
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest : displays the value which is integer or float.
Peak exercise ST segment : 1 = upsloping 2 = flat 3 = downsloping
Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
Thal : displays the thalassemia : 3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversable defect
Diagnosis of heart disease : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 0 = absence 1,2,3,4 = present.
